# Notebook-Gui
In this repository I created a small notebook project in C++ using the Qt-creator development environment.

My notebook offers several useful features:
"Save": With this function, you can save the current entry to a text file. Just click the "Save" button, choose a path and filename, and your entry will be saved for future use.
"Load": This function allows you to load previously saved records from a text file. Click the "Upload" button, select a file, and the contents of the file will be displayed in a text editor.
"New Entry": If you need to start a new entry, simply click the "New Entry" button and the contents of the text editor will be cleared.
"Open last entry": With this function, you can quickly open the last saved entry. Just click the "Open Last Entry" button and the contents of the last saved file will be loaded into a text editor.
"Open Multiple Recordings": This feature allows you to select and open multiple recording files at the same time. Just click the "Open multiple entries" button, select multiple files, and each entry will be opened in a separate text editor.
